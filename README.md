# Card Workout

A simple iOS app that generates workouts based on a deck of cards. 
Each card represents a different exercise, and the number on the card dictates the number of reps. 
The app is built using iOS 15.4, Swift 5.1 and StoryBoard, offering a fun and random way to stay fit.

## Features


Each suit corresponds to a different exercise (e.g., hearts = sit-ups, spades = pushups).
Numbered cards represent the number of reps (e.g., 7 of hearts = 7 sit-ups).
Face cards (e.g., Jack = 11 reps).
A fun and engaging way to mix up your workout routine.
